# Hunt The Wumpus
A Java implementation of the game [Hunt The Wumpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus) for a Microsoft programming competition.

My senior year of highschool, my friends and I worked on an extra-curricular project in AP Computer Science where we created an implementation of Hunt The Wumpus for java for a programming competition at Microsoft.
